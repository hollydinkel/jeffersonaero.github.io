Holly Dinkel is pursuing a doctorate in aerospace engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with the Bretl Research Group. She is interested in the role of robotic systems in enabling the exploration, development, and habitation of extreme environments. She researches problems in collaborative robotic assembly for industrial robots, robotic perception with the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) Intelligent Robotics Group, and robotic manipulation in collaboration with the NASA Johnson Space Center Dexterous Robotics Laboratory. Prior to beginning her doctoral studies, Holly researched robotic manipulation with the Assistive Robotic Manipulation Laboratory at Stanford University and distributed spacecraft autonomy at NASA ARC. Holly previously worked as a risk analyst for the Space Launch System rocket at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, in radiochemistry at Argonne National Laboratory, in accelerator physics at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, and in nuclear energy at the University of Missouri. In her free time, Holly enjoys playing the clarinet in chamber and orchestral ensembles, mentoring students in STEM, and brainstorming and realizing her dreams for the future.
